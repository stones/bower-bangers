# Bangers Webfont Kit

Webfont kit for [Bangers](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Bangers) created by [New Typography](http://code.newtypography.co.uk/).

> Bangers is a comicbook style font which packs a punch! It was designed in the style of mid-20th century superhero comics cover lettering in mind.

This is part of the Google font suite, so you should use that if you don't want to serve them from your server. 

When possible or in development I prefer to use local versions of the fonts so  that I don't have to wait for the font to download.


Installable via [Bower](http://bower.io):

    bower install fontkit-bangers
    
The package contains both [css](styles/font.css) and [less](src/less/bangers.less) files.

To see the font in action, the package contains an [example](docs/examples/primary.html) to view.
